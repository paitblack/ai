    "| **Criteria**            | **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)**                                   | **A* Search**                                             |\n",
    "|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Heuristic Used**       | Only uses the heuristic (e.g., Manhattan distance, number of wrong tiles). | Uses both heuristic and actual cost (`g + h`).             |\n",
    "| **Goal**                 | Tries to move towards the goal state as quickly as possible based on heuristic. | Balances between cost so far (`g`) and heuristic (`h`).    |\n",
    "| **Cost Consideration**   | Ignores the cost of the path so far (`g`), focuses only on the heuristic (`h`). | Takes both the path cost (`g`) and heuristic (`h`) into account. |\n",
    "| **Completeness**         | **Incomplete**: May not find the solution if there are loops or local minima. | **Complete**: Guaranteed to find the solution if one exists. |\n",
    "| **Optimality**           | **Not optimal**: The solution found may not be the shortest or best one. | **Optimal**: Always finds the optimal solution (shortest path) if the heuristic is admissible. |\n",
    "| **Efficiency (Time)**    | Usually faster than A* since it ignores the path cost (`g`).          | Generally slower than GBFS due to additional cost computation (`g`). |\n",
    "| **Efficiency (Space)**   | Can use less memory than A* since it doesn't store path costs, but can still grow large in certain cases. | Typically uses more memory than GBFS due to storing both `g` and `h` values for all nodes. |\n",
    "| **Exploration Strategy** | Prioritizes exploration of nodes that appear closest to the goal based on heuristic. | Explores nodes that minimize the combined cost of path and heuristic (`g + h`). |\n",
    "| **Handling of Loops**    | Prone to getting stuck in loops or revisiting the same states without making progress. | Less prone to loops due to combining path cost and heuristic, though still requires proper handling of revisited nodes. |\n",
    "| **Use Cases**            | Suitable for scenarios where a quick approximation is needed and the heuristic is strong. | Ideal for problems where both accuracy and optimality are important. Used in many pathfinding problems. |\n",
    "| **Pros**                 | - Can be faster than A* when a good heuristic is used.<br> - Simple to implement.<br> - Can find solutions quickly when heuristic is well-suited. | - Guarantees finding the optimal solution if the heuristic is admissible.<br> - Always complete.<br> - Balances exploration and exploitation. |\n",
    "| **Cons**                 | - Can get stuck in local minima.<br> - May explore misleading paths based solely on the heuristic.<br> - Not guaranteed to find the best or even any solution.<br> - Prone to inefficiencies due to re-exploring nodes. | - Slower than Greedy BFS due to maintaining path cost.<br> - Higher memory usage due to storing both `g` and `h`.<br> - More computationally expensive. |\n"
